## Voting System with Data Visualization
# This project is a user-interactive voting system built in MATLAB. It allows users to cast votes for candidates, displays the voting results, and provides multiple visualization options to interpret the results. It's a great way to learn about user interaction and basic data visualization techniques!

- Features
Voting Mechanism: Users can vote for four candidates (A, B, C, D).

Vote Counting: Tracks and tallies votes accurately.

Winner Declaration: Determines the winning candidate based on the highest votes.

Data Visualization: Offers three visualization methods:

Bar Chart

Pie Chart

Scatter Plot

Menu for Visualization: Users can select the visualization type interactively.

Installation
Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.

Download or clone this repository:

bash
Navigate to the project directory and open the script file in MATLAB.
Copy it

Usage
Run the script in MATLAB.

Enter the total number of voters when prompted.

Each voter will be asked to cast their vote by selecting a number (1-4) corresponding to a candidate.

The system will tally the votes, display the vote counts, and announce the winner.

Use the visualization menu to view results as a Bar Chart, Pie Chart, or Scatter Plot.

Code Example
Here's a snippet of the voting functionality:

matlab
for i = 1:numVoters
    fprintf('\nVoter %d:\n', i);
    fprintf('1. Candidate A\n');
    fprintf('2. Candidate B\n');
    fprintf('3. Candidate C\n');
    fprintf('4. Candidate D\n');
    vote = input('Enter your vote (1-4): ');

    switch vote
        case 1
            votes(1) = votes(1) + 1;
        case 2
            votes(2) = votes(2) + 1;
        case 3
            votes(3) = votes(3) + 1;
        case 4
            votes(4) = votes(4) + 1;
        otherwise
            fprintf('Invalid vote! Please enter a number between 1 and 4.\n');
    end
end
